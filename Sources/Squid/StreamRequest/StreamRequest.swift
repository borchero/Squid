/// returns a `Stream` which allows for receiving arbitrarily many values as well as sending values.
/// Apart from that, working with a stream request is very similar to working with an HTTP request.
/// It is also scheduled against an API represented by an `HttpService`. However, the service's
/// retriers as well as its headers are ignored. Still, the `Service.process(_:)` method is called.
